Data structures
    Linked list
        Insertion of node in LL at beginning, end and nth position
        Deletion of node from LL at beginning, end and nth position
        Deletion of node with particular value
        Reverse LL (Iterative method and Recursive method)
        Print LL in forward and reverse order (Iterative method and Recursive method)

    Doubly Linked list
        Insertion at a position in LL
        Deletion from a position in LL
        Print/Traverse LL in forward order
        Print LL in reverse order
    
    Stacks
        Implementation of stacks using Array - Push, Pop, Top, IsEmpty
        Implementation of stacks using Linked list - Push, Pop, Top, IsEmpty
        Implementation of stacks using CPP STL - Push, Pop, Top, Empty, Size
